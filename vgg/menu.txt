1. random_vgg.py: 
- generate vgg like graph randomly
- python random_vgg.py #
- ‘#’ represents the number of graphs want to generate
(the description of how to generate graph is in the file)

2. read_vgg.py(you do not need this file):
- read the vgg graph 
- python read_vgg.py #
- ‘#’ represents which graph want to read

3. vgg_generator.py:
- run the graph on gpu
- python generator.py #
- ‘#’ represents which graph want to run

4. read_vgg_sequence.py:
- get the label of each graph
- python read_vgg_sequence.py #
- ‘#’ represents which graph label want to get
(the description of label is in the file)

test set:
1. vgg.py:
- run test vgg graph on gnu
- python vgg.py #
- ‘#’ represents graph name:
	vgg11
	vgg11_bn
	vgg13
	vgg13_bn
	vgg16
	vgg16_bn
	vgg19
	vgg19_bn

2.vgg_label:
- get the label of test vgg
- python vgg_label.py #
- ‘#’ represents graph name:
	vgg11
	vgg11_bn
	vgg13
